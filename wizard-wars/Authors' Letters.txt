Welcome to the WizardWars.io codebase!

This project began May 28th, 2018. It was a bright and sunny day in Halethorpe, MD. I had finished my Bachelor's degree that very day (on the rare Decade plan), and wanted to jump right into an idea that I'd been chewing on for almost 2 years. A crossover between my favorite time-wasters: NetHack and Slither.io.

I soon found myself having daily discussions with my old friend QP, a more experienced programmer. His guidance was crucial in building an extensible foundation with the Entity-Component architecture. On August 13 when my funemployment ended, QP took up my slack and created most of the AIs and some of the cooler items in the game. We each put a lot of individual work in, but we also constantly synced up on plans and problems, and systematically built the game out as best we could.

I also have to thank:
	-Iris the beautiful statistician, who was cheerleading for me from day one. 
	-Bill the poodle pup, who made damn sure I took plenty of breaks and walks. 
	-The teachers at Bikram Yoga Catonsville, who helped me get out of my head.
	-The Skayl team, who saw the prototype and set me to work on real problems.

This is a game that could be added to endlessly; Between the two of us, we have enough ideas to keep busy for years. But it's time to move on to something new. As we put the code out into the world, it's my dream that someone will be inspired to contribute, branch, or even just steal it. Maybe someday this will be the first of many letters from various Wizards.
